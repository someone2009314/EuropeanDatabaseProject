Soccer is the worldâ€™s most popular sport, played by billions and celebrated globally [1]. Winning matches hinges on scoring goals, which in turn depend on creating shooting opportunities. Understanding the factors that lead to more shooting chances can help the biggest teams like Real Madrid and Liverpool optimize player training and strategies. But what causes more shooting chances? If teams figure out the most impactful factors that increase shooting opportunities, they will be able to train their players more effectively, and as a result win more trophies. My overall approach was to use a dataset that contained technical and tactical factors of actual soccer teams, and using classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBClassifier to accurately predict the shooting opportunities.  All models were evaluated with common classification metrics such as f1_score, precision, and recall. Accuracy was not an appropriate metric to use given the imbalance in shooting opportunities created by the teams in the dataset, with a majority of the teams belonging to a single class. Using accuracy would thus lead to bias in the model.

After data preprocessing and model training, features that affect shooting opportunities are positioning during build up, positioning during chance creation, passing during chance creation and defensive pressure.
